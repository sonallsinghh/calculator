This repository contains a Java program that evaluates arithmetic expressions. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, handles operator precedence and parentheses, and includes error handling for division by zero.

## Description

The `Main.java` file contains the implementation of an expression evaluator that converts infix notation to postfix notation using the Shunting-yard algorithm and then evaluates the postfix expression.  It can handle multi-digit numbers and decimal values.

## Features

* **Infix to Postfix Conversion:** Converts arithmetic expressions from infix notation (e.g., `2 + 3 * 4`) to postfix notation (e.g., `2 3 4 * +`).
* **Postfix Evaluation:** Evaluates expressions in postfix notation to produce the final result.
* **Operator Precedence:** Correctly handles operator precedence (multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction).
* **Parentheses Support:** Supports parentheses to override default precedence.
* **Multi-digit Numbers and Decimals:** Handles integer and decimal numbers of arbitrary length.
* **Error Handling:** Includes error handling for division by zero.
* **Clear Input/Output:** Prompts the user for an expression and displays the result or an error message.
